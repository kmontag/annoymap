Total hack.  Intended to be run as a cron job every minute - it'll pop up notifications more or less often depending on how many messages are in your gmail inbox(es), in the hopes of convincing you to keep an empty inbox.  Ripped from http://google-mail-xoauth-tools.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/python/xoauth.py (you can use that script to generate oauth tokens for your gmail accounts).  To add inboxes, create *.annoy files in ~/.annoymap/ , which should be Yaml-formatted like such:

user: <gmail username>
oauth_token: <generated oauth token>
oauth_token_secret: <generated secret>

The crontab entry for Ubuntu 11.10 looks like:

* * * * * DISPLAY=:0 /path/to/annoymap

The display variable needs to be set for DBus notifications.
